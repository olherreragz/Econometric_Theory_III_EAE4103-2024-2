# Tarea 4

Since everything here is Monte Carlo, no data is required as dependency to this assignment.

**Warning**: Due to large Monte Carlo simulations plotted, pages 9, 14, 15, and 19 of `T4_TE3.pdf` may cause an application hang or system freeze on some devices.


## Order execution of codes

No specific order is required to replicate this assignment. However, the chronological order corresponding to the instructions is:

- `random_walk_with_drift.py`
- `critical_values_montecarlo.py`
- `phis_0975.py`
- `break.py`
