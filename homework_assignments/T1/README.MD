# Tarea 1

The file `TE3_T1-21.Ago.24.pdf` contains the assignment instructions, while the file `T1_TE3.pdf` contains the answers report.

**Warning**: Due to large Monte Carlo simulations plotted for Inflation and Yen Returns, page 32 of `T1_TE3.pdf` may cause an application hang or system freeze on some devices.

## Order execution of codes

To automatically replicate results, execute codes in the following order:

- `1_1_b_correlogramas_parciales.py`
- `1_3_b_correlogramas_parciales.py`
- `parte_2.py`
- `pregunta_2.m`
    - Dependencies: `LagOrderSelectionARp.m`
- `parte_2.2.py`
- `parte_2.3.py`


For Python code execution, the user must close any open plot windows to allow the program to finish running.
